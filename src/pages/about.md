## Our background

Infrared Radiant Systems is an Ohio-based company that travels from coast-to-coast across the USA to install overhead radiant heating systems.

## What We Do

We have converted numerous maintenance shops away from costly unit heaters and into fuel efficient, CNG compliant heating systems. In warehouses and manufacturing facilities our system puts the heat on the workers, not just the air. Recover warmth quickly and save on expensive fuel costs with an overhead radiant heating system.
